### About

I am passionate about tackling innovative, impactful products. I like to pull from both my childhood with two metalsmith parents and my formal education in aeronautical engineering to design elegant products that move us forward. I thrive under pressure, lead design teams to exceed project goals, and am relentlessly incorporating bleeding edge technology to improve my workflow. Let's open the next chapter and build something awe-inspiring together!
